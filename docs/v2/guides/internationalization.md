Internationalization of a Timber theme works pretty much the same way as it does for default WordPress themes. Follow the guide in the [WordPress Theme Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/) to setup i18n for your theme.

Twig has its own i18n extension that gives you `{% trans %}` tags to define translatable blocks, but there’s no need to use it, because with Timber, you have all you need.

## Translation functions

Timber supports all the translation functions used in WordPress:

* __()
* _x()
* _n()
* _nx()
* _n_noop()
* _nx_noop()
* translate()
* translate_nooped_plural()

The functions `_e()` and `_ex()` are also supported, but you probably won’t need them in Twig, because `{{ }}` already echoes the output.

**WordPress:**

```html
<p class="entry-meta"><?php _e( 'Posted on', 'my-text-domain' ) ?> [...]</p>
```

**Timber:**

```twig
<p class="entry-meta">{{ __('Posted on', 'my-text-domain') }} [...]</p>
```

### sprintf notation

You can use sprintf-type placeholders, using the `format` filter:

**WordPress:**

```html
<p class="entry-meta"><?php printf( __('Posted on %s', 'my-text-domain'), $posted_on_date ) ?></p>
```

**Timber:**

```twig
<p class="entry-meta">{{ __('Posted on %s', 'my-text-domain')|format(posted_on_date) }}</p>
```

If you want to use the `sprintf` function in Twig, you have to [add it yourself](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/guides/functions/#make-functions-available-in-twig).

## Generating localization files

To generate `.pot`, `.po` and `.mo` files, you need a tool that supports parsing Twig files to detect all your translations. While there are a lot of tools that can parse PHP files, the solution that works best for Twig files is [Poedit](https://poedit.net/).

### Generating l10n files with Poedit 2

[Poedit 2](https://poedit.net/) fully supports Twig file parsing (Pro version only) with the following functions: __(), _x(), _n(), _nx().

### Generating l10n files with Poedit 1.x

Internationalization functions in Twig files are not automatically parsed by gettext in Poedit 1.x. The are multiple workarounds listed below.

**Note however that the first two methods may miss some strings**. Quotes can cause gettext to skip over `__` calls. Here’s an example for a string in an HTML attribute that won’t be recognized:

```twig
<nav aria-label="{{ __('Main menu', 'my-textdomain') }}" />
```

As a workaround, you could assign the translation to a variable, which you can then use in the attribute.

```twig
{% set nav_aria_label = __('Main Menu', 'my-text-domain') %}
<nav aria-label="{{ nav_aria_label }}">
```

#### Let gettext parse Twig files as PHP files

The quick and dirty workaround is to start each Twig file with `{#<?php#}`. By doing this, gettext will interpret whatever comes next as PHP, and start looking for `__`.

#### Use a custom Python parser

Alternatively, you can use a custom parser for Python instead. This will throw a warning or two, but *most* of your strings are extracted! ("Most" because this method has the same problems with quotes as the PHP workaround above.) To add the parser, follow these steps:

1. Create a Poedit project for your theme if you haven't already, and make sure to add `__` on the _Sources keywords_ tab.
2. Go to _Edit_ > _Preferences_.
3. On the _Parsers_ tab, add a new parser with these settings:
    * Language: `Timber`
    * List of extensions: `*.twig`
    * Parser command: `xgettext --language=Python --add-comments=TRANSLATORS --force-po -o %o %C %K %F`
    * An item in keyword list: `-k%k`
    * An item in input files list: `%f`
    * Source code charset: `--from-code=%c`
4. Save and Update!

#### Use Twig Gettext Extractor

Another solution is [Twig Gettext Extractor](https://github.com/umpirsky/Twig-Gettext-Extractor), a special Twig parser for Poedit. The linked page contains instructions on how to set it up.
