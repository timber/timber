Timber 1.x shipped with the [Upstatement/routes](https://github.com/Upstatement/routes) package for custom routes (see [Routing Guide](https://timber.github.io/docs/v1/guides/routing/) for Timber v1). However, Timber 2.x and above ships **without a default routing library**.

If you still want to use Routing as it were before, you can install the package yourself:

```bash
composer require upstatement/routes
```

Hereâ€™s a selection of routing options that you can use in conjunction with Timber:

- [Upstatement/routes](https://github.com/Upstatement/routes)
- [Rareloop/router](https://github.com/Rareloop/router)
- [Brain-WP/Cortex](https://github.com/Brain-WP/Cortex)
