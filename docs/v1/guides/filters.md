## General Filters

Twig offers a variety of [filters](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/filters/index.html) to transform text and other information into the desired output. In addition, Timber has added some valuable custom filters for your WP theme:

## excerpt

When you need to trim text to a desired length (in words)

**Twig**

```twig
<p class="intro">{{post.post_content|excerpt(30)}}...</p>
```

**Output**

```html
<p class="intro">Steve-O was born in London, England. His mother, Donna Gay (n√©e Wauthier), was Canadian, and his father, Richard Glover, was American. His paternal grandfather was English and his maternal step-grandfather ...</p>
```

## function

Runs a function where you need. Really valuable for integrating plugins or existing themes

**Twig**

```twig
<div class="entry-meta">{{function('twenty_ten_entry_meta')}}</div>
```

**Output**

```html
<div class="entry-meta">Posted on September 6, 2013</div>
```

## <del>function (deprecated)<del>
Runs a function where you need. Really valuable for integrating plugins or existing themes

**Twig**

```twig
<div class="entry-meta">{{'twenty_ten_entry_meta'|function}}</div>
```

**Output**

```html
<div class="entry-meta">Posted on September 6, 2013</div>
```

* * *

## relative
Converts an absolute URL into a relative one, for example:

```twig
My custom link is <a href="{{ 'https://example.org/2015/08/my-blog-post' | relative }}">here!</a>
```

```html
My custom link is <a href="/2015/08/my-blog-post">here!</a>
```

* * *

## pretags
Converts tags like `<span>` into `&lt;span&gt;`, but only inside of `<pre>` tags. Great for code samples when you need to preserve other formatting in the non-code sample content.

* * *

## sanitize

Converts Titles like this into `titles-like-this`

**Twig**

```twig
{{post.title|sanitize}}
```

**Output**

```html
my-awesome-post
```

* * *

## shortcodes

Runs text through WordPress's shortcodes filter. In this example imagine that you've added a shortcode to a custom field like `[gallery id="123" size="medium"]`

**Twig**

```twig
<section class="gallery">
{{post.custom_shortcode_field|shortcodes}}
</section>
```

**Output**

```html
<section class="gallery">
Here is my gallery <div class="gallery" id="gallery-123"><img src="...." />...</div>
</section>
```

* * *

## time_ago

Displays a date in timeago format:

**Twig**

```twig
<p class="entry-meta">Posted: <time>{{post.post_date_gmt|time_ago}}</time></p>
```

**Output**

```html
<p class="entry-meta">Posted: <time>3 days ago</time></p>
```

* * *

## truncate

**Twig**

```twig
<p class="entry-meta">{{ post.character.origin_story | truncate(8) }} ...</p>
```

**Output**

```html
<p class="entry-meta">Bruce Wayne's parents were shot outside the opera ...</p>
```

* * *

## wpautop

Adds paragraph breaks to new lines

**Twig**

```twig
<div class="body">
	{{post.custom_text_area|wpautop}}
</div>
```

**Output**

```html
<div class="body">
	<p>Sinatra said, "What do you do?"</p>
	<p>"I'm a plumber," Ellison said.</p>
	<p>"No, no, he's not," another young man quickly yelled from across the table. "He wrote The Oscar."</p>
	<p>"Oh, yeah," Sinatra said, "well I've seen it, and it's a piece of crap."</p>
</div>
```

* * *

## list

Converts an array of strings into a comma-separated list.

**PHP**

```php
<?php
$context['contributors'] = array('Blake Allen','Rachel White','Maddy May');
```

**Twig**

```twig
Contributions made by {{contributors|list(',','&')}}
```

**Output**

```html
