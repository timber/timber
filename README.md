### Because WordPress is awesome, but the_loop isn't
Timber helps you create fully-customized WordPress themes faster with more sustainable code. With Timber, you write your HTML using the [Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) separate from your PHP files.

This cleans up your theme code so, for example, your PHP file can focus on being the data/logic, while your Twig file can focus 100% on the HTML and display.

This is what Timber's `.twig` files look like (from this [Hello World example](https://gist.github.com/jarednova/dc75030fd2c7dd6fe52a6fef459c450e))

```twig
{% extends "base.twig" %}
{% block content %}
  <h1 class="big-title">{{ foo }}</h1>
  <h2 class="post-title">{{ post.title }}</h2>
  <img src="{{ post.thumbnail.src }}" />
  <div class="body">
	{{ post.content }}
  </div>
{% endblock %}
```
Once Timber is installed and activated in your `plugins` directory, it gives any WordPress theme the ability to take advantage of the power of Twig and other Timber features.

### Installation

The GitHub version of Timber requires [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and is setup for inclusion _within_ a theme or plugin. If you'd prefer one-click installation for your site, you should use the [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/) version.

```shell
cd ~/wp-content/themes/my-theme
composer require timber/timber
```

If your theme/plugin is not setup to pull in Composer's autoload file, you will need to

```php
/* functions.php */
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');
```

After this line, initialize Timber with
```php
$timber = new \Timber\Timber();
```

### What Now?

Setup the [Timber Starter Theme](https://timber.github.io/docs/getting-started/setup/#use-the-starter-theme). Once you have that installed in your WordPress setup, continue reading the [Getting Started guide to Themeing](https://timber.github.io/docs/getting-started/theming/).

### Mission Statement

Timber is a tool for developers who want to translate their HTML into high-quality WordPress themes through an intuitive, consistent and fully-accessible interface.
* **Intuitive**: The API is written to be user-centric around a programmer's expectations.
* **Consistent**: WordPress objects can be accessed through common polymorphic properties like slug, ID and name.
* **Accessible**: No black boxes. Every effort is made so the developer has access to 100% of their HTML.

#### What does it look like?
Nothing. Timber is meant for you to build a theme on. Like [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) it comes style-free, because you're the style expert. Instead, Timber handles the logic you need to make a kick-ass looking site.

#### Who is it good for?
Timber is great for any WordPress developer who cares about writing good, maintainable code. It helps teams of designers and developers working together. At [Upstatement](http://upstatement.com) we made Timber because while our entire team needs to participate in building WordPress sites, not everyone knows the ins-and-outs of the_loop(),  codex and PHP (nor should they). With Timber your best WordPress engineer can focus on building the `.php` files with requests from WordPress and pass the data into `.twig` files. Once there, designers can easily mark-up data and build out a site's look-and-feel.
