### ⚠️ Important information about the Timber plugin ⚠️
> With the release of Timber 2.0, Composer is the only supported install method. We are unable to continue releasing or supporting Timber as a plugin on WordPress.org. We advise everyone to **[switch to the Composer based install of Timber 1 as a first step](https://timber.github.io/docs/v1/getting-started/switch-to-composer/)** as soon as possible. If you need PHP 8.2 support you will have to switch to Timber 2.0.

For more information and a list of additional resources, please visit this [discussion](https://github.com/timber/timber/discussions/2804).

## What is Timber?

> Because WordPress is awesome, but [The Loop](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/) isn’t.

Timber helps you create fully-customized WordPress themes faster with more sustainable code. With Timber, you write your HTML using the [Twig Template Engine](https://twig.symfony.com/) separate from your PHP files.

This cleans up your theme code so, for example, your PHP file can focus on being the data/logic, while your Twig file can focus 100% on the HTML and display.

This is what Timber's `.twig` files look like (from this [Hello World example](https://gist.github.com/jarednova/dc75030fd2c7dd6fe52a6fef459c450e))

```twig
{% extends "base.twig" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1 class="big-title">{{ foo }}</h1>
  <h2 class="post-title">{{ post.title }}</h2>

  <img src="{{ post.thumbnail.src }}" />

  <div class="body">
	{{ post.content }}
  </div>
{% endblock %}
```

Once Timber is installed, it gives any WordPress theme the ability to take advantage of the power of Twig and other Timber features.

### Installation

Follow the [Installation Guide](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/installation/installation/) for how to install Timber using Composer.

### What Now?

Setup the [Timber Starter Theme](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/installation/installation/#use-the-starter-theme). Once you have that installed in your WordPress setup, continue reading the [Getting Started guide to Themeing](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/getting-started/introduction/).

## Timber’s mission

Timber is a tool for developers who want to translate their HTML into high-quality WordPress themes through an intuitive, consistent and fully-accessible interface.
* **Intuitive**: The API is written to be user-centric around a programmer's expectations.
* **Consistent**: WordPress objects can be accessed through common polymorphic properties like slug, ID and name.
* **Accessible**: No black boxes. Every effort is made so the developer has access to 100% of their HTML.

### What does it look like?
Nothing. Timber is meant for you to build a theme on. Like [underscores](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) it comes style-free, because you're the style expert. Instead, Timber handles the logic you need to make a kick-ass looking site.

### Who is it good for?
Timber is great for any WordPress developer who cares about writing good, maintainable code. It helps teams of designers and developers working together. At [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com) we made Timber because while our entire team needs to participate in building WordPress sites, not everyone knows the ins-and-outs of the_loop(),  codex and PHP (nor should they). With Timber your best WordPress engineer can focus on building the `.php` files with requests from WordPress and pass the data into `.twig` files. Once there, designers can easily mark-up data and build out a site's look-and-feel.

### Should I use it?

Timber is MIT-licensed, so please use in personal or commercial work. Just don't re-sell it. Timber is used on [tens of thousands of sites](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/#showcase) (and tons more we don't know about)

## Timber 1

You can find the code for Timber 1 on the [1.x branch](https://github.com/timber/timber/tree/1.x) and read the Timber 1 documentation [over here](https://timber.github.io/docs/v1/).
