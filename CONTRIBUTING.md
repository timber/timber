## Pull Requests

Pull requests are highly appreciated. More than [150 people](https://github.com/timber/timber/graphs/contributors) have written parts of Timber (so far). Here are some guidelines to help:

1. **Solve a problem** â€“ Features are great, but even better is cleaning-up and fixing issues in the code that you discover.
2. **Write tests** â€“ This helps preserve functionality as the codebase grows and demonstrates how your change affects the code.
3. **Write documentation** â€“ Timber is only useful if its features are documented. This covers inline documentation of the code as well as documenting functionality and use cases in the Guides section of the documentation.
4. **Small > big** â€“ Better to have a few small pull requests that address specific parts of the code, than one big pull request that jumps all over.
5. **Comply with Coding Standards** â€“ See next section.

## Preparations

After youâ€™ve forked the Timber repository, you should install all Composer dependencies.

```
composer install
```

## Coding Standards

We use [EasyCodingStandard](https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard) for Timberâ€™s code and code examples in the documentation, which follows the [PSR-12: Extended Coding Styles](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).

We use tools to automatically check and apply the coding standards to our codebase (including the documentation), reducing the manual work to a minimum.

To run all checks, you can run the `qa` script.

```bash
composer qa
```

### Check and apply coding standards

We use EasyCodingStandard to automatically check and apply the coding standards.

```bash
composer cs
```

You can also apply coding style fixes automatically.

```bash
composer cs:fix
```

### Check and apply coding standards to the documentation

We can not only check coding standards in the code, but also in the Markdown documentation.

```bash
composer cs:docs
```

To apply the fixes automatically to the documentation, run:

```bash
cs:docs:fix
```

### Enforcing coding standards using pre-commit hooks

We use [GrumPHP](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp) to add pre-commit hooks which automatically check the committed code changes for any coding standard violations.

You can fix these issues automatically by running `composer ecs:fix`.

### Other commands

There are more commands that we use to ensure code quality. Usually, you wonâ€™t need them.

- `composer analyze` â€“ Runs static analysis using [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/).
- `composer lint-composer` â€“ Checks for inconsistencies in **composer.json**.
- `composer lint-composer:fix` â€“ Ensures **composer.json** consistency.

## Hooks

We use hook names namespaced by `/` instead of underscores.

```php
// ðŸš«
$context = apply_filters( 'timber_context', $context );

// âœ…
$context = apply_filters( 'timber/context', $context );
```

## Inline Documentation

The [Reference section](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/reference/) of the documentation is automatically generated from the inline documentation of the Timber code base. To document Timber, we follow the official [PHP Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/) of WordPress.

There are minor differences to the official standards:

- For class headers, we donâ€™t use `@package` or `@subpackage` tags.
- We donâ€™t use the `@access` tag.

### Ignoring Structural Elements

The documentation generator ignores a number of elements. An element (class, method, property) is **ignored when one of the following conditions** applies:

- No DocBlock is provided
- No `@api` tag is present
- An `@ignore` tag is present
- An `@internal` tag is present
- The visibility is `private` (applies to methods only)

This means that for Markdown files to be generated for a class at all, youâ€™ll need at least a DocBlock with an `@api` tag.


### Referencing class names

When referencing a namespaced class name in a type (for example in a `@param` or `@return` tag), then use the fully qualified name. Example: `\Timber\Post` instead of just `Post`.

### Code examples

Timber uses tabs for indentation, but you should always use spaces for indentation in code examples, because the resulting Markdown will have a more consistent styling.

The `@example` tag allows you add code examples to your DocBlocks, including fenced code blocks:

```php
/**
 * Function summary.
 *
 * Function description.
 *
 * @api
 * @example
 *
 * Optional text to describe the example.
 *
 * ```php
 * my_method( 'example', false );
 * ```
 *
 * @param string $param1 Description. Default 'value'.
 * @param bool   $param2 Optional. Description. Default true.
 */
function my_method( $param1, $param2 = true ) {}
```

### Reference linking with @see tag

When you use the `@see` tag, the Reference Generator will automatically convert it to a link to the [reference](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/reference/).

- Use this tag only when the referenced method has an `@api` tag, which means that it is public.
- Beware, youâ€™ll always use the notation with `::`, which you normally know from static methods. But even if the method that you link is not static, youâ€™ll have to use the double colon.

An example:

```
@see \Timber\Image::src()
```

will turn into this:

```html
<strong>see</strong>
<a href="/docs/reference/timber-image/#src">Timber\Image::src()</a>
```

### Documenting Hooks

Follow the official [Inline Documentation Standards for Actions and Filters](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/#4-hooks-actions-and-filters) to document hooks.

#### Keywords for filters and actions

A DocBlock that documents a hook should always start with the keyword

- `Filters` for filter hooks
- `Fires` for action hooks

This is needed so that the [Hook Reference Generator](https://github.com/timber/teak/blob/master/lib/Compiler/HookReference.php) can detect the comments associated with filters and actions.

#### Syntax

```php
/**
 * Filters â€¦ / Fires â€¦ (Summary)
 *
 * Description.
 *
 * `$var` Optional description of variables that might be used in the filter name.
 *
 * @see \Timber\Classname::function()
 * @link https://github.com/timber/timber/pull/1254
 * @since x.x.x
 * @deprecated x.x.x
 * @example
 * Optional text to describe the example.
 *
 * ```php
 * // A PHP example
 *
 * /**
 *  * Multiline comments are possible as well.
 *  * Youâ€™ll need to escape the closing tag with a "\".
 *  *\/
 * ```
 *
 * ```twig
 * {# A Twig example #}
 * ```
 *
 * @param type  $var Description. Default 'value'.
 * @param array $args {
 *     Short description about this hash.
 *
 *     @type type $var Optional. Description. Default value.
 *     @type type $var Optional. Description. Default value.
 * }
 * @param type  $var Optional. Description. Default value.
 */
```

#### Dynamic filters

When a filter contains a variable, it should be marked up with double quotes `"` and the variable name inside curly braces:

```php
$force = apply_filters( "timber/transient/force_transient_{$slug}", $force );
```

Additionally to this, document what the variable is by adding it to the description. Add it on a new line with the variable wrapped in backticks, so that it appears as code in Markdown:

```php
/**
 * Filters the status of a particularly named transient.
 *
 * Allows you to override the behavior on a case-by-case basis.
 * `$slug` The transient slug.
 *
 * @param bool $force Param description.
 */
$force = apply_filters( "timber/transient/force_transient_{$slug}", $force );
```

#### Multiline declaration

Formatting a filter into multiple lines when the line should be too long is allowed:

```php
/**
 * Filters â€¦
 */
$force = apply_filters_deprecated(
    'timber_force_transients',
    array( $force ),
    '2.0.0',
    'timber/transient/force_transients'
);
```

#### Unfinished filters

If a filter description is not finished yet, mark it up with the `@todo` tag. Itâ€™s okay if you donâ€™t know what a filter is doing exactly or if youâ€™re unsure about what a parameter does. Describe what needs to be done in the `@todo` tag.

```php
/**
 * Filters â€¦
 *
 * @todo Add summary, add description.
 *
 * @param bool $force Param description.
 */
```

As soon as the todo is resolved, the `@todo` tag can be removed.

## Unit tests

### Install WordPress test suite

Run the following command to install the test suite on your local environment:

```bash
bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh {db_name} {db_user} {db_password} {db_host} {wp_version}
```

Replace variables with appropriate values.

### Run unit tests

Run PHPUnit test suite with the default settings and ensure your code does not break existing features.

```bash
composer test
```

You can also run the tests without coverage.

```bash
composer test:no-cov
```

## Process

All PRs receive a review from at least one maintainer. Weâ€™ll do our best to do that review as soon as possible, but weâ€™d rather go slow and get it right than merge in code with issues that just lead to trouble.

### GitHub reviews & assignments

You might see us assign multiple reviewers, in this case these are OR checks (i.e. either Jared or Nicolas) unless we explicitly say itâ€™s an AND type thing (i.e. can both Lukas and Maciej check this out?).

We use the assignee to show whoâ€™s responsible at that moment. Weâ€™ll assign back to the submitter if we need additional info/code/response, or it might be assigned to a branch maintainer if it needs more thought/revision (perhaps itâ€™s directly related to an issue that's actively being worked on).

Once approved, the lead maintainer for the branch should merge the PR into the `master` or `2.x` branch. The 1.x team will work to resolve merge conflicts on #1617 (`2.x` into `master`) so the branches stay in sync.

### Codeowners

We use a [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/timber/timber/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS) file to define who gets automatic review invitations.
