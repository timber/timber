      **‚ö†Ô∏è Your issue about Timber 1.x**

      Support for [Timber 1.x has been dropped](https://github.com/timber/timber/discussions/2804).

      This means that your issue will likely not be addressed. We encourage all Timber users to migrate to Timber 2.x (currently RC 1).

      Please read the [migration guide](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/upgrade-guides/2.0/) and maybe the [switch to Composer guide](https://timber.github.io/docs/v1/getting-started/switch-to-composer/) if you were using the plugin version.

      **Your issue is about Timber 2.x**

      Thanks for taking the time to fill out the issue form. We can help best if you provide as much information as possible.

      Is this a support or usage question? Please post it to [Discussions](https://github.com/timber/timber/discussions) or on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/timber) using the *Timber* tag.
